Question Leetcode: 3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    string answerString(string word, int n) {
        n--;
        if(n==0) return word;
        char maxi='a';
        for(char c: word){
            maxi=max(maxi,c);
        }
        string ans="";
        for(int i=word.size()-1;i>=0;--i){
            if(word[i]==maxi){
                string tt="";
                int t=n-i;
                if(t<0) t=0;
                for(int j=i;j<word.size()-t;++j){
                    tt+=word[j];
                }
                ans=max(ans,tt);
            }

        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Diary:
1. Predict pattern & approach before coding.
Got 2 Hard consecutively in daily, knew today was going to be something a bit easy.

2. Think loud, write down why stuck.
Again took the wrong path of recursion, although it always pay me off but here that was too much, question was comparitively simple

3. Code brute force if needed â€” clarity > shortcut.
I coded complete brute force through recursion and it really helped me a lot with my skill honing for sure and it worked for like 717/785 cases

4. After solve: 1 key learning, 1 mistake, 1 pattern.
1 learning: Recursion works only when really required, always try to do different things before it.
1 mistake: mistake was again taking recursion as the first resort instead of trying simpler things
1 pattern: Pattern was normal string 

5. Maintain learning diary.

6. Categorize problems weekly, target weak areas.
String greedy
7. Re-solve & explain tough problems.
