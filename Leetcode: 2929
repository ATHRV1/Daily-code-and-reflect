Question Leetcode 2929. Distribute Candies Among Children II

Solution: 
class Solution {
public:
    long long distributeCandies(int n, int limit) {
        long long ans=0;
        for(long long i=max(0,n-(2*limit));i<=min(limit,n);++i){
            // cout<<i<<endl;
            long long d=n-i;
            if(d>=limit){
                ans+=(limit-(d-limit))+1;
            }
            else ans+=d+1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Diary:
1. Predict pattern & approach before coding.
I was almost pretty sure i would have to use Recursive with memoization approach or Dynamic Programming until I saw the Constraints, 1e6 i need a single for loop to solve the problem nothiing more would suffice in the time complexity given by leetcode

2. Think loud, write down why stuck.
Here I was stuck in the actual logic only i mean how do you even think of distribution i knew i needed to use permutation and combnation but how i mean this was not something regular

3. Code brute force if needed â€” clarity > shortcut.
I bruteforced by counting every possible combination and it did paid off in finding a pattern

4. After solve: 1 key learning, 1 mistake, 1 pattern.
1 learning: Although this problem followed normla stats and bars combinatorics with some modification i think my approach is still better because it is clear and simple so i should not just follow standard ways to solve problems and try to come up with my own logic as well
1 mistake: my mistake was in the actuall mathematics of the logic which i solved afterwards 
1 learning; come with your own ways to tackle problems do not be a lakeer ka fakeer

5. Maintain learning diary.
6. Categorize problems weekly, target weak areas.
7. Re-solve & explain tough problems.
