Question: Leetcode: 2928 Distribute Candies Among Children I

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCandies(int n, int limit) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<=n;++i){
            for(int j=0;j<=(n-i);++j){
                for(int k=0;k<=(n-i-j);++k){
                    if(i<=limit && j<=limit && k<=limit && (i+j+k)==n){
                        ans++;
                    }
                } 
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

Diary:
1. Predict pattern & approach before coding.
This question I specifically tried out after solving the second part of this question with combinatorics

2. Think loud, write down why stuck.
I wanted to try the bruteforce properly so i did this question and it paid off i did get confused again between recursive and dp approach

3. Code brute force if needed â€” clarity > shortcut.
Chose this one specifically to try out my brute force and turns out i just needed 3 for loops nested to count every possibility

4. After solve: 1 key learning, 1 mistake, 1 pattern.
1 learning: do not make each combination brute force questioin complex by doing recursion dp etc.
1 mistake: tried complex ways to solve even though just needed a single for loop structure
1 learning; do try out solving with brute force once in a while, it increases the coding and thinking skill

5. Maintain learning diary.

6. Categorize problems weekly, target weak areas.
even though simple brute force it was good to come up with a solution, this was normla brute force counting pattern

7. Re-solve & explain tough problems.
