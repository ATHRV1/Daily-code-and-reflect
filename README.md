# Daily Code and Reflect 

A journey of consistent problem-solving and mindful learning across multiple competitive programming platforms.

## What's This About?

This repository documents my daily coding practice with a focus on **deliberate learning** rather than just solving problems. Each day includes solutions from **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **Codeforces** along with detailed reflections.

## My Learning Framework

### Before Coding:
1. **Predict pattern & approach** before coding
2. **Think loud** - write down why I'm stuck

### During Coding:
3. **Code brute force if needed** â€” clarity > shortcuts

### After Solving:
4. Extract **1 key learning**, **1 mistake**, **1 pattern**
5. **Maintain learning diary** with insights

### Weekly Review:
6. **Categorize problems weekly**, target weak areas
7. **Re-solve & explain** tough problems

*"The goal isn't just to solve problems, but to build problem-solving intuition through consistent practice and reflection."*
