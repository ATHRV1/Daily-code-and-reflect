Question: Leetcode: 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCandies(vector<int>& s, vector<int>& c, vector<vector<int>>& k,
                   vector<vector<int>>& cb, vector<int> bb) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (bb.size() > 0) {
            bool cc = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < bb.size(); i++) {
                int box = bb[i];
                cout << box << endl;
                if (s[box] == 1) {
                    cc = true;
                    if (!cb[box].empty()) {
                        for (int j = 0; j < cb[box].size(); ++j) {
                            bb.push_back(cb[box][j]);
                        }
                    }
                    if (!k[box].empty()) {
                        for (int j = 0; j < k[box].size(); ++j) {
                            s[k[box][j]] = 1;
                        }
                    }
                    ans += c[box];
                    swap(bb[i], bb[bb.size() - 1]);
                    bb.pop_back();
                    i--;
                }
                // cout<<bb.size()<<endl;
            }
            if (!cc)
                break;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};


Diary:
1. Predict pattern & approach before coding.
Just did 1 Hard today was not sure of this second one until I saw the Acceptance rate, 65% is not bad although very less people tried

2. Think loud, write down why stuck.
Question was not conceptually hard but difficult to program, I mean it was brute force but required very careful coding, A nap helped me a lot

3. Code brute force if needed â€” clarity > shortcut.
The question was almost brute force only and it did really helped to build the solution while thinking from first principles from scratch

4. After solve: 1 key learning, 1 mistake, 1 pattern.
1 learning: Think calmly and properly to solve these kind of questions
1 mistake: a very little mistake in for loops which i usually make it wasted a lot of time but still but i will remember to be more careful
1 pattern: This was pure brute force and kind of Constructive

5. Maintain learning diary.

6. Categorize problems weekly, target weak areas.
Brute force, Constructive Algo

7. Re-solve & explain tough problems.
